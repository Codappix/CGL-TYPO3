Coding Guideline for TYPO3
==========================

What does it do?
----------------

The goal of this package is to provide our TYPO3 cgl rules, which are based on `cgl-php`_, via composer.
The package uses PHP_CodeSniffer to sniff the configured files and show errors.

Current state
-------------

This is the initial version of this ruleset. We are currently using our PHP rules.
Custom rules and sniffs will follow when needed.

This is a early version. More information can be taken from Github at
`current issues`_.
